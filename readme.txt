This plugin adds a new widget where you can view your old posts by expanding certain years and months.

== Description ==

Expanding Archives adds a widget that shows your old posts in an expandable/collapsible format. Each post is categorized under its year and month, so you can expand all the posts in a given month and year.

This plugin comes with very minimal CSS styling so you can easily customize it to match your design.

Expanding Archives uses Font Awesome icons in a few places, so having that installed is recommended. However, the widget still functions perfectly fine without them.

JavaScript is required.

You can see the widget in action in my blog's sidebar: https://www.nosegraze.com/

== Installation ==

1. Upload `expanding-archives` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to Appearance -> Widgets and drag the Expanding Archives widget into your sidebar.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I change the appearance of the widget? =

The plugin does not come with a settings panel so you have to do this with your own custom CSS. Here are a few examples:

Change the year background colour:

`.expanding-archives-title {
    background: #000000;
}`

Change the year font colour:

`.expanding-archives-title a {
    color: #ffffff;
}`

== Screenshots ==

1. The widget on my blog. This version has custom CSS applied.
2. The widget on the Twenty Fifteen theme, with only the default styles applied.
3. No widget settings - just add and save!
